## Description
This project is a classic Snake game developed in C as an academic project.
The game runs in the Windows console and uses keyboard inputs to control
the snake's movement.

It was created to strengthen programming fundamentals such as algorithmic
thinking, control structures, file handling, and low-level logic.

## Features
- Snake movement using arrow keys
- Random food generation
- Snake growth after eating food
- Score calculation based on snake length
- Multiple lives system
- Collision detection (walls and snake body)
- Game over handling
- Score recording system

## Controls
- Arrow Keys: Move the snake
- ESC: Exit the game

## Score Storage
The game stores player names and scores in a local text file (`record.txt`)
using file input/output operations in C. This allows keeping a history of
previous game sessions.

## Technologies
- C programming language
- Windows Console API
- Standard C libraries

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g. GCC or Code::Blocks).
2. Run the executable in a Windows environment.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the game.

## Academic Context
This project was developed during the early years of my undergraduate
studies to practice core programming concepts and strengthen my foundation
in computer science.

## Screenshots
Screenshots of the game interface and gameplay can be found in the
`screenshots/` folder.
